## Dotfiles
Please feel free to make suggestions or fork as a starting place for your own.

The Makefile is overly simple, but at the moment it gets the job done for what's in here.
Run `vagrant up`, and you get nodenv + nodenv 4.2.1, pyenv + python 2.7.11, `tox`, and `awscli`.
Feel free to update your own setup as you wish.
